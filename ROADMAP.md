## Project Setup
    
- [x] Set up your development environment with the necessary tools and libraries.
- [x] Create the HTML5 video player where the subtitles will be displayed.

## Subtitle Parsing (using ass-compiler)
    
- [x] Implement a parser for ASS/SSA subtitle files. These files have a specific format, so you'll need to extract the relevant information, such as text content, timing, and styling.

## Subtitle Storage (using ass-compiler)
    
- [x] Decide on a data structure to store the parsed subtitles. You might use an array or an object to organize subtitle entries.

## Display Subtitles
    
- [x] Ensure that subtitles are synchronized with the video playback.
- [ ] Create a function or component that takes the parsed subtitles and displays them on the HTML5 video player at the appropriate times.

## Text Styling
    
- [ ] Implement support for subtitle text styling, such as font size, color, and positioning. Apply these styles to the displayed subtitles.

## Subtitle Positioning
    
- [ ] Handle subtitle positioning, which may include bottom-center, bottom, or custom positions based on the ASS/SSA file.

## Subtitle Formatting
    
- [ ] Render subtitles with proper line breaks and formatting (e.g., italics, bold) as specified in the subtitle file.

## Subtitle Timing
    
- [ ] Ensure accurate timing synchronization between the video and subtitles. Subtitles should appear and disappear at the correct moments.

## User Controls
    
- [ ] Implement user controls for enabling/disabling subtitles and adjusting subtitle settings (e.g., font size, background opacity).

## Subtitle File Selection
    
- [ ] Add functionality for users to select and load ASS/SSA subtitle files for the video.

## Error Handling
    
- [ ] Implement error handling for cases where subtitle files are missing, improperly formatted, or cannot be loaded.

## Testing
    
- [ ] Test your subtitle renderer with a variety of ASS/SSA files to ensure it handles different formats and edge cases gracefully.

## Performance Optimization
    
- [ ] Optimize subtitle rendering for performance, especially with longer videos and complex subtitle styling.

## Documentation
    
- [ ] Create clear and comprehensive documentation for how to use your subtitle renderer, including API documentation if applicable.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility
    
- [ ] Test your subtitle renderer on various web browsers to ensure it works consistently across different platforms.

## Accessibility
    
- [ ] Ensure that your subtitle renderer is accessible to users with disabilities, including support for screen readers.

## Localization (Optional)

- [ ] Consider adding support for multiple languages in your subtitles and provide a way for users to switch between them.
